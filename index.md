Here is **Yangtao Fang (方扬涛)**. 

I am a graduate student in the DataAI master's program at Institut Polytechnique de Paris (IP Paris). 
I conducted research on computer vision-based foot contact detection for long jump, under the supervision of [Dr. Sao Mai Nguyen](http://nguyensmai.free.fr/Home.html) (Associate Professor, Flowers Team, U2IS laboratory). Prior to IP Paris, I have worked on Medical Robotics with [Dr. Jianye Niu](http://202.206.253.123/mdt/teachers_show.aspx?shid=505) (Associate Professor, Rehabilitation Medicine and Parallel Robot Technology and Applications Team, Yanshan University).

<span style="color: #E8D4A3;">I am actively seeking a 5–6 month internship from late March to September 2026, after which I will be available for full-time employment. If you have any information, please contact me. Thank you!</span>
