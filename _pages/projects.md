## ViT-LSTM-Foot-Contact-Detection
- **Hightlight**: The project proposes a hybrid Vision Transformer (ViT) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) model with an attention-based fusion mechanism to accurately classify the degree of foot-ground contact during the long jump, using video captured at only 25 frames per second.

## Biomimetic Micro Robot for Intestinal Diagnosis and Treatment
- **Hightlight**: Designed a biomimetic micro robot for intestinal diagnosis and treatment as part of my graduation project at Yanshan University. The robot uses soft materials and micro-actuators to navigate the digestive system.
