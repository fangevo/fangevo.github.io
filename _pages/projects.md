# Automated Traffic Monitoring System
- **Hightlight**: The project uses YOLOv5 for real-time vehicle type detection and counting in north and south directions. It includes a GUI for manually setting vehicle flow thresholds per direction, issuing warnings when exceeded, and automatically adjusting thresholds based on weather (sunny > rainy > snowy).

# Computer vision-based foot contact detection for long jump using a monocular normal-speed camera
- **Hightlight**: The project proposes a hybrid Vision Transformer (ViT) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) model with an attention-based fusion mechanism to accurately classify the degree of foot-ground contact during the long jump, using video captured at only 25 frames per second.

# Biomimetic Micro Robot for Intestinal Diagnosis and Treatment
- **Hightlight**: Designed a biomimetic micro robot for intestinal diagnosis and treatment as part of my graduation project at Yanshan University. The robot uses soft materials and micro-actuators to navigate the digestive system.
