# Calligraphy
<p>
  <img src="/assets/images/Calligraphy.jpeg" alt="Calligraphy" style="max-width: 400px; height: auto; float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
  I started learning calligraphy in the fourth grade of elementary school and have won awards in provincial and municipal calligraphy competitions. During the Chinese Spring Festival, I write couplets (traditional calligraphy decorations used for blessings) to give to family and friends. However, due to heavy academic commitments in recent years, my calligraphy skills have declined, and I hope to find time to continue practicing.

  Public speaking helps to develop a person's courage, communication skills, and logical thinking ability. I am a person who is passionate about sharing — from academic knowledge, research work, and internship experiences, to my personal journey of striving step by step from a rural village to becoming a graduate student in Paris.

Listening to music is my favorite way to relax. Since high school, I have developed a strong interest in exploring the mysterious world of Hi-Fi, where acoustics and electronics converge.

    When I was younger, I preferred reading physical books. However, nowadays I enjoy listening to audiobooks instead, because my reading speed is quite slow — it takes me over 10 hours to finish a 300-page book. About seven years ago, I developed the habit of listening to audiobooks (or podcasts) for 10 to 30 minutes every day.
